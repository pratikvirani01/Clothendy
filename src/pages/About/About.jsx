                        <p>
                            Thenmozhi Designs began as an Instagram-based business with just handloom cotton sarees. Sindhu Rajaram
                            launched this handloom-focused brand in 2018, following her love for colors and passion for the art of
                            curation. Sindhu's love for sarees had its origin from her grand mother and mother as any other little girl.
                            Brand is named after her beautiful working mother who inspired the little girl with her colour combinations and
                            pretty cotton sarees until her retirement.

                        <p>
                            Soon after, with Sindhu's unwavering commitment and passion, coupled by the finest quality handloom sarees,
                            the brand was recognized for its quality and curation.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            During this time, in 2021, we welcomed Dhivyaa Rajaram, Sindhu's elder sister into the brand. Her love and
                            dedication for the brand led her to make the difficult decision to leave a high-level corporate career and
                            join hands with Sindhu to make Thenmozhi Designs a family affair. Dhivyaa, with her corporate experience and
                            ability, was able to streamline processes and brought in effective strategies, resulting in improved performance.

                        <p>
                            Growing in strength, the brand diversified products and expanded its product lines, adding salwar sets, kurtas
                            and the hand hand-picked Kanjivaram Silk sarees for the most memorable days of our life.
