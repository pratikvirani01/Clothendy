            <h2>How does Clothendy use pixel tags?</h2>

            <p>
              We use “pixel tags” (also called “web beacons” or “clear gifs”),
              which are tiny graphic images, on our website and in our emails.
              Pixel tags help us analyze our customers’ online behavior and
              measure the effectiveness of our website and our advertising. We
              work with service providers that help us track, collect, and
              analyze this information.
            </p>

            <p>
              Pixel tags on our website may be used to collect information about

              of the website you visited immediately before coming to our
              website. Because we do not track our website users over time and
              across third-party websites, we do not respond to browser
              do-not-track signals.
            </p>

            <p>
              Pixel tags and cookies in our emails may be used to track your

            </p>

            <p>
              We also work with third-party companies that use tracking
              technologies to serve advertisements on our behalf across the
              Internet. These companies may collect information about your
              visits to our website and third-party websites and your
              interaction with our advertising and other communications. Please

              personally identify you or any other user of the site.

            <p>
              Aggregated personal information does not personally identify you
              or any other user of the site, (for example, we may aggregated
              personal information to calculate the percentage of our users who
              have a particular telephone area code).
            </p>

              purpose, except where we are required to do otherwise under
              applicable law. If we are required to treat Other Information as
              personal information under applicable law, then we may use and
              disclose Other Information for all the purposes for which we use
              and disclose personal information.
            </p>
            <p>
              In some instances, we may combine Other Information with personal
              information (such as combining your name with your birthday or
              likes or combining information collected from cookies with your
              personal information). If we combine any Other Information with
              personal information, the combined information will be treated by
              us as personal information as long as it is combined.
            </p>

              To make sure you are accessing our secure server before you submit
              personal financial information, look at the lower left-hand corner
              of your browser. If you see an unbroken key or a closed lock

              you have accessed a secure server, the first characters of the
              address in that line should change from “http” to “https.”
